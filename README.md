## Intro

In this project, I apply a ETL method for all UFC fighters and all the fights between 1994 and 2021. With all the data cleaned and transformated, I have used Random Forest model to make predictions of a fight between two fighters to select. In this case, I predicted the winner in Glover Teixeira vs Jiri Prochazka, Valentina Schevchenko vs Taila Santos and Alexander Volkanovski vs Max Holloway, all of them are title fights in June 2022.
